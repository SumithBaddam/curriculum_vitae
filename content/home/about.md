# Biography

I am enrolled as graduate student in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington and will be graduating by May 2020.

I worked as Data Scientist at Cisco Systems Inc. for 2.5 years where my key focus was on building large-scale machine learning models to improve the quality of Cisco's products. While working at Cisco, I have filed a [patent](http://www.hrpub.org/download/20180930/AEB7-11812034.pdf) for one of the business use-cases and have published 2 papers in predictive modeling using Deep Learning.

Prior to joining Cisco, I was pursuing Masters and Bachelors in Technology in Information Technology from IIIT-Bangalore. 

I was also a key note speaker at International Conference of Business Analytics and Intelligence at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore in 2017 and Indian Institute of Science in 2018.
