  description = "Built a prediction model for prioritizing the bugs identified during testing phases whether to be fixed fast or can wait. Unstructured bug attributes like descriptions, error log files along with 170 structured fields were used for building the system. It was implemented using LSTM and CNN in Keras and TensorFlow."
